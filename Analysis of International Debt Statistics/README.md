## About the Dataset


International Debt Statistics Dataset is provided by The World Bank. In this dataset, we will be able to observe various countries with their debt amounts. These countries used these debt amounts in their development works or improvement of infrastructure. 

It is an EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) project where we will try to find different insights from this dataset and draw the conclusion on different aspects. I have used MySQL to conduct the whole procedures of this project.
